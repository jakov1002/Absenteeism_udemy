*The first two notebooks state "currently doing" - I completed the course. 
The third notebook is the final ML-related part of the course and contains the Python and mySQL database integration part.

The "(1)" and "(2)" within two of the files' names - I improved the notebooks' readability, phrasing, and clarified some parts beyond the necessary explanations. I did this before the completion of the course.
