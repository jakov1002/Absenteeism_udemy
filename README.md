The preprocessing, machine learning, model (re)application, and Python integration part of Udemy's Integrating Python, SQL, and Tableau course which I completed. 

I did not just follow along, I had to find solutions to errors and do some things differently.

All necessary code explanations are contained at the beginning of the notebooks themselves. By doing this I tried to show my understanding of the subject matter.

Best viewing sequence:

1.absenteeism_udemy_preprocessing (2)

2.absenteeism_udemy_ML(1)

3.absenteeism_model_(re)application_integration

*The first two notebooks state "currently doing" - I completed the course. 
The third notebook is the final ML-related part of the course and contains the Python and mySQL database integration part.

The "(1)" and "(2)" within two of the files' names - I improved the notebooks' readability, phrasing, and clarified some parts beyond the necessary explanations. I did this before the completion of the course.
